cs56-games-Go
=============

A gui version of the Chinese board game called Go.
README file updated by Nicholas Abrahan & Keith Waldron, CS56, W14, Proj1;


# The Current State of the Project
=============

The game, as it currently stands works, but it's missing some gameplay fundamentals. It doesn't implement area and territory scoring, and there are soem gameplay bugs (such as the one outlined in the Ko rule of the game). All of these are outlined in the issues.

But again, the game currently works, and the scoring is simply based on the amount of tiles held by one player. Capturing in the basic sense works, just not in a larger scale such as with territory/area scoring. 

# Developer Notes
=============

The code might need a little overhaul. As it currently stands, it's a little difficult to understand, let alone make changes to, the code. A little problem you might run into also, is trying to understand the game itself. It's a pretty deep game, with little caveats here and there that makes the gameplay a little more confusing than usual. But the rules are in the game, as well as a source that goes into a little more detail than the in-game instructions panel does.

# File Explanation
=============
DISCLAIMER: We are only human. We are not entirely, 100% sure, about this, since we weren't the original creators of the code. But this is a little guideline.

STUB: WORK IN PROGRESS



# Running the Game

simply use the command:
```
ant run
```
